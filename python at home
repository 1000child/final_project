            Yeah, that's right. I'm enrolled in Business Study.

            Cool! I was too, so if you ever want a different opinion on a project, just ask me, ok? Let me know anytime you need help.

            Um... sure. Thanks.

            Hey, uh... no offense, but you don't seem too thrilled to be here. 
            
        mc:
            None taken. And yeah, I mean, the school's great and all, but I'm mostly here to take the strain off my family. They don't need another mouth to feed hanging around.

        Ryner:
            Why'd you go through all the trouble to get in to this school then if you don't even want to be here? There are so many other places you could get into. Why put in the effort for this one?

        mc:
            Well... when I graduate, I don't want to return back to being a burden for my family- if I get recognized by this school, I'm bound to get a decent job in the government or something.

        Ryner:
            Jeez. You know, I bet your family wouldn't want you to just slave away your days here; they'd probably want you to enjoy yor life, too. It doesn't all have to be about money and burdens!

        mc:
            I guess.

        Ryner:
            I'm serious! I just mean, your family wouldn't want you to be so hard on yourself, that's all.

            ...Thank you.

        mc:
            Nevertheless, thank you.

        Ryner:
            Hmmm... Alright! Looks like we've made a full loop around, now we're at the Auditorium.

    (A large, squat building is sitting in front of where you two are standing now)

            Thanks again

            Yeah, talk to you later sometime. Good luck at Orientation!

            Nah, when I met her in the halls earlier, she snapped at me and Jessica, and I quote, "to scram," and "do something worthwhile with our meatsuits". 

        mc:
            Huh?

        FemaleStudent:
            Yeah, and she even threatened to give us detention for loitering! I'm Jessica, by the way.

        mc:
            Whoa... looks like we're in for a rough year. Dang it! ...I just want to peacefully graduate from this place and support myself.

        Jessica:
            Well, as long as she's our teacher, the 'peaceful' part of that might have to be put on hold. Hey Seita, you're in class 1A too, right?

        Seita:
            Yurp. Man, I was really hoping to get a teach who'd ignore it if I forgot my homework. This lady looks like she'll whip me if I have a crinkle on the paper!

            I second that.

            I get the feeling she just doesn't like any of us. Ha, see? She's over there in the corner, staring us all down.

        Seita:
            Huh, I never would have even noticed he was there. Hey, that's creepy: some kid is standing right next to her. I understand the weirdo teach, but why's he staring us all down like that?

            Alright, now that I've got your attention, I'll make this brief. I'm sure the lot of you are proud to have made it into this prestigious school, and you all share dreams of graduating and leading a long, fulfilling career in our fine military. I'm also sure that at least half of you will not graduate at all. My job from this day forward is to push you until you break, then break you again and again until we can remake you into something worth keeping around. Savor this moment, while you still enjoy living. Buckle up, boy and girls, you've got nothing but a grueling four years ahead of you. ...That will be all. ")

            Any questions? No? --Good, then let's get started on what we came here to do. First things first, we've got written and physical exams. We'll use this to measure your potential and progress throughout the year. Last place student is expelled. Prepare yourselves.")

#---meet friends at bfast who're in his class

#---beginning of class [PE minigame during], cut to final bell

#---friends invite mc to spend night in their shared room

#---drinking involved-- choice to participate

#---busted by Dr. Matis who's suspiciously out late

#---Dr. Matis approaches mc, Matis tries to bring over mc to turn "traitor" [running away minigame starts]

#---mc in game is inevitably is chased by either head (later expelled, w/ dissappointed family and friends) or Matis (later saved by the head)-- headmaster comes across them in the end if Matis chases and catches mc
