#meet friends at bfast who're in his class

#beginning of class [PE minigame during], cut to final bell

#friends invite mc to spend night in their shared room

#drinking, smoking involved-- choice to participate (end up doing anyway)

#busted by Dr. Matis who's suspiciously out late- Matis speaks w mc privately afterwards

#Matis asks mc to keep an eye out for 'suspicious students' to cover up his own activities and warns mc "trust NO ONE"

#next day, some dorm room doors have scary threat from rivals spray painted on- was done overnight

#mc approaches Dr. Matis, Matis tries to bring over mc to turn "traitor" [running away minigame starts]

#mc in game is inevitably is chased by either head (later expelled, w/ dissappointed family and friends) or Matis (later saved by the head)-- headmaster comes across them in the end if Matis chases and catches mc

#end message: stick to your morals even in strange/poor situations
